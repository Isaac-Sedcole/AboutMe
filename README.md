# AboutMe
An introduction to who I am and the projects i'm working on.

I'm a full stack developer who is looking forward to furthering myself and my skills and expanding my knowledge in the tech area/industry.

I started studying at Enspiral Dev Academy in November 2020, and graduated in March 2021. The most recent commits (between January and February) will be a bit patchy as all the students were working in groups/pairs and as such some commits were made from different sources.

I am passionate about everything tech related, music, education, exploring, food and exercise.

# Ongoing projects

### GlassHomes
A website where tenants are able to leave reviews for rental properties.

My role in this project was CTO(Chief Technical Officer) and git main(Manager). I helped the team with any techincal issues that arose and managed all the github merging conflicts and everything.

### GamePicker
This is a personal project website where users can sign up and then choose other users to group with in order to find out what games they have in common.

I built this due to the fact that I can never decide what games to play with friends. And so I decided to make a website that can automatically collate all the games everyone has and if everyone owns it, that will show. It also shows you games that are owned by everyone except 1 person. This allows that one person to purchase and then play the game with all their other friends.

### Learning more languages
I am using Udemy to learn more languages and further my knowledge in Java, Python and Unity 2D and 3D.
