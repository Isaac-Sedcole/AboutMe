# About Me
An introduction to who I am and the projects i'm working on.

I'm a full stack developer who is looking forward to furthering myself and my skills and expanding my knowledge in the tech area/industry.

I started studying at Enspiral Dev Academy in November 2020, and graduated in March 2021. The most recent commits (between January and February) will be a bit patchy as all the students were working in groups/pairs and as such some commits were made from different sources.

I am passionate about everything tech related, music, education, exploring, food and exercise.

# Ongoing projects

### GlassHomes
A website where tenants are able to leave reviews for rental properties.

My role in this project was CTO(Chief Technical Officer) and git main(Manager). I helped the team with any techincal issues that arose and managed all the github merging conflicts and everything.

### GamePicker
This is a personal project website where users can sign up and then choose other users to group with in order to find out what games they have in common.

I built this due to the fact that I can never decide what games to play with friends. And so I decided to make a website that can automatically collate all the games everyone has and if everyone owns it, that will show. It also shows you games that are owned by everyone except 1 person. This allows that one person to purchase and then play the game with all their other friends.

### DrinkingGames
This is app that is supposed to start out as an encyclopedia of drinking games for you to pick from but has lots of potential to expand into developing our own game and implenting helpful features.

### Learning more languages
I am using Udemy to learn more languages and further my knowledge in Java, Python and Unity 2D and 3D.
